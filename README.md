## Razzle Introduction

Razzle helps you pair your code with natural language to create a new way of building applications. Especially those internal applications/backoffice applications that are not exposed to the public. <br />Let's face it we engineers tend to punt on those applications because they are not sexy and we don't want to spend time on them.
<br /> Razzle is a way to get those applications built quickly and easily letting you focus on the important stuff and delighting your users.
