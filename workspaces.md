# Workspaces & Apps

Quite simply, a workspace is a collection of Razzle apps, and a Razzle app is a collection of Actions. Our idea in creating workspaces is that there are probably a qroup of Razzle apps created by our user that probably work together. For instance, if you are building an expense manager app, you might have an app for managing employees, another for managing expenses, and another for managing companies. These apps are probably going to be used together, so we created the concept of a workspace to group them together.

When you create a new workspace we automaticcally add a the Razzle Workspace Manager app.
